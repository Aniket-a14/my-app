Now if you have copied the code, from github, Pallavi from my github or yours, then run this code in your terminal:

npm install

This will install all the dependencies required for the project.
node modules will be created in the root directory of the project.

But if you have followed the steps in the prev readme file, then you will not have to run this command again.
just wrrite the following command in your terminal:
npm run dev
This will start the development server and you can see your project running on localhost:3000.
