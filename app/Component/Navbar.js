    //return is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to return a value from a function.
    //In this case, it returns a JSX element that represents the Navbar component.
}

// This component is the Navbar of the application.
// It is a functional component that returns a simple div with a message.
// The Navbar component is exported as the default export of the module.
// This allows it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
// The Navbar component can be used to display navigation links or other elements in the application.
// The component does not currently have any props or state.
// It is a simple static component that can be expanded in the future.
// The Navbar component can be styled using CSS or other styling methods.
// It can also be enhanced with additional functionality, such as handling clicks or navigation.
// The Navbar component is a good starting point for building a more complex navigation system in the application.
// The component can be imported into other files using the import statement.
// For example, it can be imported into the app/layout.js file to be included in the global layout of the application.
